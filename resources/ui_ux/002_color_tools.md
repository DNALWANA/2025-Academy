## Hallo!!, how was it after learning about Figma? ^_^

Certainly exciting, having learned one of the initial stages in website development, which is designing the website itself.

Now, in designing, the selection of colors becomes crucial for creating a website. Sometimes, ideas or inspirations for a color emerge when we observe a design in a logo, a specific website, or other sources. 

Therefore, for ease in finding the color code corresponding to the colors we see, we certainly need a real-time color picker tool. Hence, we will use **Instant Eyedropper** for that purpose.
