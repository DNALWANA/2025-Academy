# Forking
If you look at the videos from section 6, you might have ever heard about `fork`, obviously this is not the kind of fork you might use to eat :D.

So fork in github is a way for other user to `copy` a repository from another user as their repository inherited from that other user, confusing huh ?

Lets just look at this diagram below, supposed your github username is `n00bnN3wbs` have a repository called `meme_all_the_things`:


```
n00bnN3wbs/meme_all_the_things
``` 


And then there is your friend whose username is `pr0ma8` and this person fork your friend, then the diagram will look like this:

```
n00bnN3wbs/meme_all_the_things   -->   pr0ma8/meme_all_the_things 
```

Those two repositories have the exact same things inside with the exact same version histories, BUT...

If pr0ma8 make his changes in his repository, the changes will only happen in pr0ma8 repository, and it will not affect n00bnN3wbs meme_all_the_things repository, and vice versa.

This is useful for team collaboration, because one can make changes to a repository inherited from one same repository without having any intervention with other people changes.

So for this course, you can now open https://github.com/Daskom-Lab/2024-Academy.git and then fork the repository to your account by clicking on the `fork` button on the upper right corner (in the desktop view).

And by that, you should now have your_username/2024-Academy repository inherited from Daskom-Lab/2024-Academy, congratulations on your first fork üç¥.
