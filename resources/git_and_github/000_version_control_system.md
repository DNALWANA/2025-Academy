# Version Control System

Version control systems are essential software tools that record and manage changes to files, particularly source code. They track modifications over time, allowing multiple users to collaborate efficiently, revert to previous versions, and maintain a comprehensive history of project developments.

## Why is the Version Control system so Important?

As we know that a software product is developed in collaboration by a group of developers they might be located at different locations and each one of them contributes to some specific kind of functionality/features. So in order to contribute to the product, they made modifications to the source code(either by adding or removing). A version control system is a kind of software that helps the developer team to efficiently communicate and manage(track) all the changes that have been made to the source code along with the information like who made and what changes have been made.

## Understanding GIT and GITHUB

After understanding what a Version Control System (VCS) is, the next step is to familiarize ourselves with the tools we'll be using: Git and GitHub. These tools are fundamental in managing and collaborating on software projects efficiently. Before delving into GitHub, it's essential to first learn about Git. Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes. It keeps a complete history of all changes made, enabling us to revert to any previous state of the project if needed. Mastering Git will give us the foundation needed to manage our codebase effectively and collaborate seamlessly with team members. Once we have a solid understanding of Git, we can then explore GitHub.
