# Push
As said before, the commited changes only happen locally, so to have those versions in the remote git server such as github you have to run `git push`.

Pushing your local version to github means that all those versions that you have locally will also be available in the github website.

To verify this, you can go to your github and see if there are any changes that you have made there, moreover you can also click the `history` button to see all versions you have made along the way.
