# Re-explore
Now all that you have know the basic usage of git and github, you have to explore more by yourself to understand more about it and get an even deeper understanding for each command that you have learned this far.

Here are all the links you can use to do that:
- https://youtu.be/BCQHnlnPusY (Youtube playlist by The Coding Train [english])
- https://www.petanikode.com/tutorial/git/ (Written tutorial by petanikode.com [indonesian])
- https://git-scm.com/docs (Git Documentation, this is really useful if you want to understand each command *really* deep)

You dont have to understand all things first btw, but its good if you want and can do that, starting from next section we will talk about making contribution to an already existing repository.

GLHF!
